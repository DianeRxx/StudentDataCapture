			<a id="Graduate">Technology Graduate Scheme</a></h2>
			<p>
				Our full-time Technology Analyst Development Programme will place you at the epicentre of an organisation where fast-changing business priorities and market conditions call for constant innovation and cutting-edge technologies.
				We recruit a significant number of people from technical and analytical backgrounds with an interest and aptitude for technology. We also welcome graduates from mathematical and analytical backgrounds or technical specialists in areas such as infrastructure, software or information architecture, who are interested in system design and engineering. Whatever your background, you’ll develop skills on some of the most advanced systems in the marketplace and enjoy opportunities to build uniquely broad experiences as you tackle challenges across our business.
				Our programme matches your talents to the skills required in the business in our key locations; Bournemouth, Glasgow and London.
			</p>
			<h2><a id="Internship">Techonlogy Summer Internship</a></h2>
			<p>
				A Technology internship at J.P. Morgan will place you at the core of the organisation, in a culture that encourages you to think "outside the box" to achieve great results for our clients. The variety of roles offered to interns is vast, with numerous opportunities to gain technology experience across all business areas, allowing you to see if a career in technology is for you.
				Whatever your background, whatever your role, you will develop skills on some of the most cutting-edge systems and products in the marketplace. You'll enjoy unique experiences as you tackle and deliver on challenges across our business.
				Internships are offered in our Bournemouth, Glasgow and London offices. The following opportunities are available:
				Summer internship — 10-week long programme between June and September aimed at penultimate year undergraduate students, including students in their final year expecting to take a masters.
				Six-month internships — six-month industrial placements starting in April, aimed at penultimate year undergraduate students or those in their final year expecting to take a masters.
			</p>
			<h2><a id="Spring Technology Week">Spring Technology Week</a></h2>
			<p>
				Based at our London office, you'll spend one week learning more about Technology at J.P. Morgan. You'll meet with recent analysts who were once in your position and hear from our senior leaders. With an opportunity to work shadow with our business, you'll soon learn where your skills are best suited.
				Your technical skills will be put to the test during the week through a two-day Coding Challenge.
				Our recruiters will be on hand to answer any questions about our application process and offer practical advice on how to prepare for our assessment centres. This is an excellent way to find out early about our careers and get yourself noticed.

			<h2><a id="Open Technology Position">Open Technology Position</a></h2>
			<p>
				Our technologists work on huge IT projects, some playing a major role in securing our biggest deals.
				Take our Bear Stearns merger, for example. On March 16, 2008, it was announced that J.P. Morgan was acquiring Bear Stearns.
				The superiority of the technologies we used allowed a historic deal to take place in a matter of days.
				Our technology enabled us to transfer an incredible several hundred thousand transactions from Bear Stearns to J.P. Morgan over one single weekend.
				This is just one example from the diverse list of achievements and ongoing projects that keep our technologists challenged and engaged.
